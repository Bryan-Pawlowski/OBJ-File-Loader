#VeldridMan

Veldrid is a super sweet c# graphics toolset which hastens the setup time for a graphics project. At least, that is my
one-sentence synopsys. I am using it to re-create a learning tool I had in college called GLMan, developed by 
Prof. Mike Bailey at Oregon State University. GLMan is a realtime graphics-based riff on Pixar's tool, RenderMan.
GLMan was as a tool to learn realtime shader programming. This project is not meant to supplant GLMan, but to try to
recreate it from memory, with a DirectX backend.
