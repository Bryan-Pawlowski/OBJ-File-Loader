OBJ-File-Loader
===============

This project is just simple obj loading code that I'd like to make available to other programmers doing raw DirectX development. 
Tests for this will be both checked against simple hard-coded 3-d Objects and also a simple DirectX renderer. 
Any suggestions or contributions to this code are very welcome!

--As of yet, this code won't support sub-objects right out of the gate.
--Simple parsing of storage of info will just store vertices.
